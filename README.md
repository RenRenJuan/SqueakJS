# SqueakJS
Our fork of SqueakJS

At the time of fork, none of the 67 existing seemed to have addressed the issues I need addressed so 
making another with that intent, viz, to get networking and filesystem working to a minimum supportable 
level. In the unlikely event those are found in working order someplace I'll use that and drop this fork.

These are all I need to work with a Squeak6 base so I don't expect to have a lot of activity after they do
to track changes in source or any of the other forks.
