# SqueakJS
Our fork of SqueakJS

At the time of fork, none of the 67 existing seemed to have addressed the issues I need addressed so 
making another with that intent, viz, to get networking and filesystem working to a minimum level 
needed for WebSPO and WebKEE. In the unlikely event those functions are found in working order
someplace I'll either merge them here if separate or drop this fork and use the thing with both.

These are all I need to work with a Squeak6 base so I don't expect to have a lot of activity after they do
to track changes in source or any of the other forks.

Unlike desktop Squeak, I'm only supporting SqueakJS on a best effort basis, running SPO and KEE in a browser
is mainly for demonstration purposes though it will have a convenience value if a serviceable baseline is 
achieved.
